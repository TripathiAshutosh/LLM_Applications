The report was released by RSF, and it indicates a decline in India\\'s ranking for press freedom. There are more than 100,000 newspapers (including 36,000 weeklies) and 380 TV news channels currently operating in the country. Since January 1, 2023 one journalist was killed in the country while 10 journalists are behind bars. This year’s report shows the number of countries deemed “satisfactory” for their treatment of journalists rising slightly, but so does the number where the situation is “very serious”.\\n\\nWorld Press Freedom Index 2023: India • India\\'s rank in the Security indicator category is particularly concerning, as it has fallen to 172 out of 180 countries in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index. This means that only eight countries have a worse ranking than India when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of journalists. • In terms of this parameter, India is ranked worse than all other countries except for China, Mexico, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, and Myanmar, with Myanmar having the lowest ranking. • India\\'s performance in the World Press Freedom Index is also poor compared to other countries in South Asia. Bangladesh ranks slightly worse than India at 163, while Pakistan ranks ahead of India at 150. • Surprisingly, even Afghanistan, where the Taliban government is known to restrict independent journalism, has a better ranking than India, at 152. Bhutan has a much better ranking at 90, while Sri Lanka is ranked at 135. World Press Freedom Index 2023: Globally • Nordic countries like Norway, Ireland, and Denmark ranked top three respectively while Vietnam, China, and North Korea were the bottom three countries on the index. • Russia, where the government has largely completed its quelling of independent media, fell nine places to 164th. Despite the Russian invasion and its own issues with oligarchs, Ukraine rose 27 places to 79th.

The World Press Freedom Index is based on five different factors that are used to calculate scores and rank countries. These five sub-indicators include the Political indicator, Economic indicator, Legislative indicator, Social indicator, and Security indicator.

Although these banknotes will no longer be issued, they will retain their status as legal tender. The move comes as the objective of introducing the ₹2000 banknotes has been fulfilled, and other denominations now adequately meet the currency requirements of the economy. Reasons for Withdrawal The introduction of ₹2000 banknotes in November 2016 was a response to the withdrawal of legal tender status for ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes. This measure aimed to fulfill the urgent currency requirements at the time. However, the printing of ₹2000 banknotes was halted in 2018-19 as their purpose had been served. Furthermore, the RBI noted that the usage of ₹2000 banknotes for transactions was not common.\\n\\n9\\n\\nwww.bankersadda.com\\n\\n|\\n\\nDeclining Circulation Approximately 89% of the ₹2000 banknotes were issued before March 2017 and have now reached their estimated life-span of 4-5 years. Consequently, the total value of ₹2000 banknotes in circulation has decreased from ₹6.73 lakh crore at its peak on March 31, 2018, to ₹3.62 lakh crore, constituting only 10.8% of the total notes in circulation as of March 31, 2023. The reduction in circulation and limited usage further prompted the decision to withdraw the ₹2000 banknotes. Clean Note Policy The withdrawal of ₹2000 banknotes aligns with the RBI\\'s \"Clean Note Policy.\" This policy aims to maintain the quality of currency in circulation and promote efficiency in the banking system. The RBI had previously undertaken a similar withdrawal of notes from circulation in 2013-2014. Procedures for the Public To facilitate the withdrawal process, the RBI has provided guidelines for the public. Individuals can deposit ₹2000 banknotes into their bank accounts or exchange them for banknotes of other denominations at any bank branch. Deposits can be made in the usual manner, without any restrictions, subject to existing instructions and statutory provisions. Exchange Process In order to ensure operational convenience and minimize disruption to regular banking activities, individuals can exchange their ₹2000 banknotes for banknotes of other denominations. This exchange can be done up to a limit of ₹20,000/- at a time at any bank, starting from May 23, 2023.\\n\\nThe RBI\\'s 19 regional offices and other banks will be involved in this exchange process. Timeline and Legal Tender Status While the RBI has initiated the withdrawal process, it emphasizes that the ₹2000 banknotes will remain legal tender. Individuals have until September 30, 2023, to exchange or deposit their ₹2000 banknotes in their bank accounts. After this date, banks may stop accepting ₹2000 banknotes for exchange, although they can still be deposited into bank accounts.\\n\\nSouth Asian Youth TT Championship 2023 The South Asian Youth Table Tennis Championship 2023, a three-day international event, came to a close on May 17 in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh.
